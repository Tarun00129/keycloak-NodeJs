To format this text according to a typical README file in a Git repository, we can follow these guidelines:

1. Add a title: Give your document a clear title that describes its purpose. For example, "Keycloak Implementation with Node.js Guide."

2. Add headings: Use headings to organize your content. Use `#` for main headings and `##` for subheadings.

3. Use bullet points: Use `-` or `*` for bullet points to list out steps or items.

4. Use code blocks: Use triple backticks (\`\`\`) for code blocks to distinguish code from regular text.

5. Use links: Use `[text](link)` format for including links in the text.

Here's the formatted text:

# Keycloak Implementation with Node.js Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides instructions for implementing Keycloak with Node.js for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in your application.

- Node.js version: 18.0.0
- Keycloak version: 24.0.2
- Medium article link: [Simple Keycloak RBAC with Node.js & Express.js](https://medium.com/@erinlim555/simple-keycloak-rbac-with-node-js-express-js-bc9031c9f1ba)

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- Keycloak setup
- Ability to generate user access tokens

## Setting Up Node.js Project

1. Initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```bash
   npm init
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   npm i cors dotenv express jsonwebtoken keycloak-connect nodemon
   ```

3. Add start script to package.json:
   ```json
   "start": "nodemon app.js"
   ```

4. Create base project files:
   - app.js
   - routes/test.js

5. Run the base project:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Verify the API works by accessing `http://localhost:<port>/api/test`.

## Configuring Keycloak

1. Create a new realm named "MYREALM".
2. Create a client in the realm and note the Client ID.
3. Create a realm role (e.g., "admin") for the realm.
4. Add at least two users, assigning roles accordingly.

## Implementing RBAC in the API

1. Add Keycloak Realm and Client ID to your .env file.
2. Create a Keycloak middleware for your routes.
3. Add the middleware to your routes.
4. Test the middleware using Postman.
